# CS2 Kernel-Level Game Enhancer

This is an open-source, external, read-only kernel-level gameplay enhancer for Counter-Strike 2.

## What does this mean?

-   **Open Source**: The entire project's source code is publicly available, allowing anyone to access, review, and learn from it.
-   **External**: This program operates completely outside the CS2 process and doesn't rely on Windows API functions to access the game.
-   **Read-Only**: We don't write anything to the target process memory, eliminating the risks associated with memory manipulation.
-   **Kernel-Level**: The program uses a kernel driver to achieve maximum stealth and hide itself from user-mode detection systems.

## Purpose

This project was created solely for educational purposes, intended for those interested in learning about Windows kernel development and kernel-level memory reading/writing techniques.


# How to Use

1.  Download all files from the latest release.
2.  Load the kernel driver:
    -   Drag and drop `driver.sys` onto `kdmapper.exe`
    -   Wait for confirmation that the driver has been successfully loaded
3.  Launch Counter-Strike 2 in fullscreen winowed or window mode and wait until you're in the lobby.
4.  Start `client.exe` to activate the enhancer.
5. Press `home` button on your keyboard to activate menu

 ### Common issues
 if you have problem with loading driver follow this steps:
 - disable Core Isolation in windows defender
 -  got to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\CI\Config` in regedit and set `VulnerableDriverBlocklistEnable` to 0

# VAC
This project operates at the kernel level, while Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) functions primarily at the user-mode level. Due to this architectural difference:

VAC cannot directly detect our kernel-mode driver
The enhancer remains undetected by VAC's standard scanning methods
Our read-only approach minimizes detection vectors typically associated with memory manipulation

Important Notice: While the current implementation is designed to avoid detection, Valve continuously updates their anti-cheat systems. We cannot guarantee permanent undetectability, and users should proceed with caution.
